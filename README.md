# pdf_extracting_diu
I am working on a project, where I am going to extract details of our class routine(Girven from Daffodil International University). It's currently under construction.
I am using Python Technology to do this. It will read a PDF (of the routine of several sections, times, and classrooms) and extract a particular section's routine.
